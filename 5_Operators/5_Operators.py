# 5) OPERATORS :
# 5A) ARITHMETIC OPERATORS : +, -, *, /, %, //, **

# Thier result can be assigned to variables too :

# 5B) ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS : +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=

# NOTE:
# a) String Concatenation and Interpolation :
first_name = 'Rahul'
last_name = 'SriRam'
age = 19
# TASK: I'm Rahul SriRam and I'm 19yrs old.

# 5C) COMPARISION OPERATORS : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Can be assigned to variables too :
bool_var = (5 == 4)
print(bool_var)
print(type(bool_var))

# 5D) LOGICAL OPERATORS : and, or, not

# 5E) IDENTITY OPERATORS : is, is not
print(5 is 4) # Similar to ==
print(5 is not 4) # Similar to !=

# Can be assigned to variables too :
bool_var = (5 is 4)
print(bool_var)
print(type(bool_var))
