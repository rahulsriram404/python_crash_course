# 2) VARIABLES :
'''
NOTE:
a) No data-type is needed to be mentioned when declaring.
b) Naming rules :
    1) Can contain alpha-numeric characters(A-z, 0-9) and underscore(_), but can't start with numbers.
    2) Case-Sensitive.
c) Variables can't be just declared and left, they have to be initialized at the time of declaration only :
'''

# 2A) Declaration and Initialisation :
x = 5 # Use the assignment operator to assign literals/values to variables.

# print() can print the variable's value or the value itself to the console
print(x)
print(5)

# 2B) Assign another value to already declared variable :
x = 6
print(x)
